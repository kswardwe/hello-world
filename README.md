# Rough Draft of Project 2

Question: Are the hemagluttin from the two H3N2 strain in 2016 more similar to that of the 1968 H3N2 pandemic or the strain found in 2004?


Hypothesis:If the hemagluttins of different H3N2 human infecting strains are compared to each other, then the 2016 strain will have a higher protein sequence similarity to the 2004 and 2005 strains, which would support the pattern of the H3N2 strains decreased virus avidity?
