# Rough Draft of Project 2

Question: Are the hemagluttin from the two H3N2 strain in 2016 more similar to that of the 1968 H3N2 pandemic or the strain found in 2004?


Hypothesis:If the hemagluttins of different H3N2 human infecting strains are compared to each other, then the 2016 strain will have a higher protein sequence similarity to the 2004 and 2005 strains, which would support the pattern of the H3N2 strains decreased virus avidity?

To run the code provided in files successfully will need to download a couple files.
  1. Project2Data.nb.html
  2. all the provided H3N2 fasta files (were found on NCBI)
  3. 1968.pdb file (found on Protein data bank)
